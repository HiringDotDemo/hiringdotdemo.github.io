<strong>4.5 Employer Materials.</strong>  Employer represents, warrants and covenants that any Employer Materials provided by Employer for use in connection with the Services will not violate any laws or regulations or third-party proprietary rights, including, without limitation, copyright, trademark, obscenity, rights of publicity or privacy, and defamation laws.  Employer hereby grants CareerBuilder a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Employer Materials and to hyperlink to Employer’s website in connection with the Services. <br>

<br>
<strong>6. Disclaimers and Limitations on CareerBuilder's Liability. </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>6.1 Allocation of Responsibility. </strong>CareerBuilder assumes no responsibility for Documents posted by Users and no responsibility for the activities, omissions or other conduct of Users.

 <br>
(b) WITHOUT LIMITATION ON THE FOREGOING:<br>
<br>
(i) CAREERBUILDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITES WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SITES AND THEIR SERVERS ARE FREE OF COMPUTER VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL MECHANISMS.

<br>
<strong>6.4 DAMAGE LIMITATIONS, ALLOCATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF. </strong><br>
<br>
(a) YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK FOR YOUR USE OF THE SITES, THE INTERNET GENERALLY, AND THE DOCUMENTS OR EMPLOYER MATERIALS THAT YOU POST, PROVIDE OR ACCESS AND FOR YOUR CONDUCT ON AND OFF THE SITES.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>6.5 User Authentication.</strong>  Because User authentication on the Internet is difficult, CareerBuilder cannot and does not confirm that each User is who they claim to be. Because CareerBuilder does not and cannot be involved in User-to-User dealings or control the behavior of participants on the Sites, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release CareerBuilder from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential and direct and indirect) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. <br>
<br>
<strong>6.6 California Residents.</strong>  If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."<br>
<br>
<strong>7. Payment of Services upon Termination of Service Agreement.</strong> If at any time during the course of this Agreement you should terminate a Service Agreement or any other services Agreement in which these Terms and Conditions have been incorporated by reference, then CareerBuilder shall reserve the right to receive all payments from you for the Services used by you up to termination and for fifty percent (50%) of the remaining unused portion of the Service Agreement.<br>

The sole relationship between you and CareerBuilder is that of independent contractors. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of all or part of a provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts and provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. All provisions of this Agreement shall survive termination except those granting access or use to the Sites, and you shall cease all your use and access thereof immediately. You may not assign or transfer your obligations under this Agreement. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. Except as expressly provided by CareerBuilder in a particular "Legal Notice," or material on particular web pages of the Sites, this Agreement and your Service Agreement where applicable, constitute the entire agreement between you and CareerBuilder. <br>
<br>

<p><strong>16. Additional Terms in Connection with Use of Resume Database. </strong> If, in your Service Agreement with CareerBuilder, you are purchasing Resume Database access, the following additional terms apply to you:<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>16.2 </strong>The Resume Database is to be accessed and used solely by those Users whom you authorize to access the Resume Database through your account (each an “Authorized RDB User”).   Each Authorized RDB User will be issued a unique Resume Database Seat (a “Seat”) through which they can perform the actions described in 16.1.  Each Seat must be purchased in advance by you and may be accessed by using unique login credentials.  You are only permitted to assign one Seat per Authorized RDB User and Authorized RDB Users may not share their login credentials or Seat access amongst themselves, with any other co-workers or with any other third parties. <br>
<br>
<strong>16.3 </strong>Authorized RDB Users may download, one at a time, up to either 50 Resumes per day (per Seat) or 3000 Resumes per month (per Seat) depending on the Resume Database product purchased by you in accordance with the terms of your Agreement. Please note that the term “download” shall include: (i) viewing or clicking on a Resume page; (ii) saving a Resume to a folder; (iii) printing a Resume; (iv) copying a Resume; (v) emailing or forwarding a Resume; and/or (vi) any other action that results or could result in your use of a Resume or any of the information contained therein. <br>

<br>
<strong>16.5 </strong> You and your Authorized RDB Users may use your subscription to the Resume Database only for seeking candidates for employment and are specifically prohibited from using information contained in the Resume Database to (i) sell or promote any products or services, (ii) send emails that, in CareerBuilder’s sole judgment, are excessive in frequency or contain job postings that are irrelevant to the work history of particular classes of Job Seekers or (iii) take any other action that is, in CareerBuilder’s sole judgment, inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions, misleading or incomplete, or in violation of any Federal, State, Local law, statute, code, rule, or regulation. Company understands and agrees that if Company uses the Resume Database in violation of the preceding restrictions, then CareerBuilder may, at its sole discretion, either terminate Company’s Agreement or transfer Company’s Seats from the Resume Database to the Targeted Resume Database (a database that only contains individuals whom CareerBuilder has identified as appropriate candidates for sales positions where the majority of the compensation is to be derived from commissions).<br>
<br>
<strong>16.6 </strong> CareerBuilder may terminate, suspend, update, alter or supplement, at its sole discretion, all or any part of the Resume Database at any time. By permitting access to the CareerBuilder Resume Database, CareerBuilder does not convey any interest in or to the Resume Database or any other CareerBuilder property or Services. All right, title and interest in and to the Resume Database is and shall remain in CareerBuilder.<br>
<br>
<strong>17. </strong>Additional Terms in Connection with Use of Recruitment Edge Services.  If, in your Service Agreement with CareerBuilder, you are purchasing our Recruitment Edge Services, the following additional terms apply to you:</p>

<p><strong>17.1 Recruitment Edge aggregates data from the open web by scanning professional networking sites, talent hubs, blogs, publications and journals, and scanning social networks to find talent.  Recruitment Edge may solely be used for candidate lead generation purposes and to make initial contact with possible candidates and must not be used to evaluate a job applicant’s eligibility for employment or a current employee’s eligibility for continued employment, reassignment or promotion.  You are prohibited from reviewing profiles of persons who are employed by you or who have already expressed interest in employment with you outside of the Recruitment Edge platform.  Any information regarding a potential candidate that is obtained from Recruitment Edge is largely derived from public sources and is not guaranteed or verified to be accurate or up to date.  Accordingly, such information should not be maintained in the individual’s application file or in any subsequent employee file.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>17.2 </strong>CareerBuilder grants Company a limited, personal, terminable, non-transferable, non-exclusive right to access Recruitment Edge via the Sites for the purpose of viewing and/or downloading a single copy of available profiles (collectively, “Profiles”) solely for Company’s internal use.  Recruitment Edge is to be accessed and used solely by Company through its authorized Users.  Company may download, one at a time, up to either 150 Profiles per day (per Recruitment Edge user license).  Please note that the term “download” shall include: (i) viewing or clicking on a Profile page; (ii) saving a Profile to a folder; (iii) printing a Profile; (iv) copying a Profile; (v) emailing or forwarding a Profile; and/or (vi) any other action that results or could result in Company’s use of a Profile or any of the information contained therein.  In addition, if a search in Recruitment Edge yields a Profile for a potential candidate who is part of the CareerBuilder Search  Database, then the search will count against that Search Database Seat’s monthly download limit rather than the Recruitment Edge Seat’s daily download limit.</p>

<p><strong>18.</strong> Additional Terms in Connection with Use of Recruitment Analytics Services.  If, in your Service Agreement with CareerBuilder, you are purchasing any of our Recruitment Analytics Services, the following additional terms apply to you: </p>

<p><strong>18.1</strong> Use of Reports.  CareerBuilder hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement), worldwide right and license to: (a) store and use any Recruitment Analytics Services for your internal management, reference or informational purposes, and (b) distribute copies of any reports generated by the Recruitment Analytics Services (each a “Report”),  subject to the conditions that (i) such copies may be distributed only in printed or static electronic PDF format, (ii) in providing a copy of any Report to a recipient, you may not charge the recipient any kind of fee or other consideration, and (iii) you shall not remove or modify any branding, marks, copyright or trademark notices, or any other notices or disclaimers set forth in any Report without CareerBuilder’s prior written consent, or otherwise modify the Report in any way so as to falsely or otherwise misrepresent its content.  Further, you may not issue press releases or make other public statements regarding any Report, or the contents or conclusions in same, without the express written consent of CareerBuilder.</p>

<p><strong>18.2</strong> Use of Your Data.  If you have purchased Recruitment Analytics Services, then you may provide CareerBuilder with the names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, resumes and other personally identifiable information of Job Seekers sourced from your own files (“Job Seeker Data”).  You hereby grant CareerBuilder a non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, store, transmit and display Job Seeker Data solely to the extent reasonably required to provide and maintain the Services for Company’s use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that CareerBuilder may derive Aggregate Data from the Job Seeker Data and may use such Aggregate Data in accordance with section 4.6.</p>
